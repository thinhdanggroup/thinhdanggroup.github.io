```json
{
    "Print to console": {
        "prefix": "pylog",
        "body": [
            "print($1)$0"
        ],
        "description": "Print output to console"
    },
    "For Loop": {
        "prefix": "pyfor",
        "body": [
            "for $1 in $2:",
            "\t$0"
        ],
        "description": "Python for loop"
    }
}
```

In this example, typing `pylog` followed by a tab will insert `print()`. The `$1` is a placeholder that you can tab through to quickly replace parts of the snippet.

### Managing Python Code Snippets

To manage your Python snippets:

- Edit existing snippets by navigating to the Python snippets file and modifying the JSON content.
- Delete snippets by removing them from the JSON file.
