As we have seen, Mojo is a promising new programming language that combines the usability of Python with the performance
of C. It is designed to provide a fast and efficient alternative to Python, particularly for applications in data
science and machine learning. But how do we use Mojo? Let's dig deeper into the concepts of Mojo programming language
and its differences with Python.

### Understanding Mojo Programming Concepts

Mojo combines the usability of Python with the performance of C. It allows you to write everything in one language, from
Python to low-level AI hardware programming. It supports progressive types, zero-cost abstractions, ownership and
borrower checker, portable parametric algorithms, and language-integrated auto-tuning. Mojo also provides access to the
entire Python ecosystem for interoperability with libraries like Numpy.

#### Variable Declaration

In Mojo, variables are declared using the keywords `let` and `var`, indicating whether they are immutable or mutable.
This is a departure from Python, where variables are mutable by default and there is no keyword for declaring them.

```mojo
let x = 10   # x is immutable
var y = 20   # y is mutable
```

#### Function Definition

Functions in Mojo are defined using the `fn` keyword. Unlike Python, Mojo functions take immutable arguments by default
and require explicit typing, as well as local variable declarations.

```mojo
fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int:
    let z = x + y
    return z

print(add(1,2))
# Output: 3
```

#### Structs

Mojo introduces the `struct` keyword, distinct from Python's class, to define types with fixed arrangements optimized
for native machine speed.

```mojo
@value
struct Rectangle:
    var length: Float32
    var width: Float32

    def __init__(inout self, length: Float32, width: Float32) -> None:
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        print("Rectangle created with length:", self.length, "and width:", self.width)

    def area(self) -> Float32:
        let area: Float32 = self.length * self.width
        print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
        return area

    def perimeter(self) -> Float32:
        let perimeter: Float32 = 2 * (self.length + self.width)
        print("The perimeter of the rectangle is:", perimeter)
        return perimeter

var myRectangle = Rectangle(10.0, 5.0)
myRectangle.area()
myRectangle.perimeter()

# Output:
# Rectangle created with length: 10.0 and width: 5.0
# The area of the rectangle is: 50.0
# The perimeter of the rectangle is: 30.0
```

In Mojo, the `@value` decorator is used to automatically generate member-wise initializers, move constructors, and copy
constructors for structs. It analyzes the fields of the struct and generates the missing members. The `@value` decorator
is similar to Python's `@dataclass` and is used to simplify the creation of structs in Mojo.

### Differences Between Mojo and Python

While Mojo is heavily influenced by Python and aims to be as user-friendly, there are some key differences between the
two languages.

1. Variable Declaration: In Python, variables are mutable by default and there is no keyword for declaring them. In
   contrast, Mojo introduces the `let` and `var` keywords to declare immutable and mutable variables respectively.

2. Function Definition: Unlike Python, Mojo functions take immutable arguments by default and require explicit typing,
   as well as local variable declarations.

3. Structs: Python uses classes to define custom types, while Mojo introduces the `struct` keyword to define types with
   fixed arrangements optimized for native machine speed.

4. Performance: Mojo is designed to be significantly faster than Python, with performance on par with system programming
   languages like C.

5. Memory Safety: While Python relies on garbage collection for memory management, Mojo introduces features like
   ownership and borrower checker for memory safety.

### Current Status of Mojo Programming Language

It's important to note that Mojo is still in its early development phase. While the language and its tooling are being
actively developed by Modular Inc, they are not yet ready to support the migration of large Python projects. However,
Python users can start by porting small, computationally demanding sections of their code to Mojo and gradually migrate
more significant parts over time as the language and tooling mature.

Mojo is a promising new programming language that combines the simplicity of Python with the speed and memory security
of C. While it is still in its early development phase, its unique features and focus on data science and machine
learning make it a language to watch out for in the future.
