### Getting Started with K9s

Once you have K9s up and running, let's explore its user interface and navigation features. K9s provides a comprehensive overview of your Kubernetes cluster, allowing you to quickly find and manage your desired resources.

The K9s interface is divided into three main sections:

- **Overview:** The overview section provides a high-level view of your cluster, including the number of nodes, pods, and namespaces. It also displays the current context and namespace. You can switch between contexts and namespaces using the `:ctx` and `:ns` commands respectively.
- **Navigation:** The navigation section allows you to browse through the different resource types in your cluster. You can filter resources by type, name, or label. You can also use the `:alias` command to create custom aliases for frequently used resource types.
- **Search:** The search bar allows you to quickly find specific resources by name or label. You can use the `?` command to access the help menu, which lists all the available commands and keyboard shortcuts.

#### Navigation

To navigate through the different resource types, simply use the arrow keys to move up and down the list. You can also use the tab key to move between the overview, navigation, and search sections.

To view a specific resource, simply select it from the list. K9s will display detailed information about the resource, including its status, metadata, and events. You can use the `enter` key to drill down into the resource, or the `esc` key to go back to the previous view.

You can also perform various actions on the selected resource, such as editing, deleting, scaling, port-forwarding, etc. You can use the `:xray` command to view the resource hierarchy, or the `:view` command to view the resource YAML.

#### Search

To search for a specific resource, simply type its name or label into the search bar. K9s will filter the list of resources to show only those that match your search criteria. You can use the `*` wildcard to match any character, or the `!` operator to negate a match.

You can also use the `:filter` command to apply advanced filters based on resource fields or expressions. For example, you can use `:filter status.phase=Running` to show only the pods that are running, or `:filter spec.containers[0].image=~nginx` to show only the pods that have nginx as their first container image.

In this section, we have provided an overview of the K9s user interface and navigation features. By understanding these features, you can quickly find and manage your desired resources within your Kubernetes cluster. You can also customize your K9s experience by using the `:config` command to edit the configuration file, or the `:skin` command to change the color scheme.

### Managing Resources with K9s

K9s offers a comprehensive set of tools for managing Kubernetes resources. In this section, we will demonstrate how to view, edit, and delete resources within K9s, focusing on keyboard shortcuts and commands. We will also provide guidance on managing different resource types, such as pods, deployments, and services.

#### Viewing Resources

To view a resource in K9s, navigate to the K9s interface and use the arrow keys to select the desired resource from the navigation pane on the left-hand side. K9s will display a detailed view of the resource, including its status, metadata, and events. You can navigate through the different sections of the resource view using the arrow keys.

K9s also features a search functionality that can be accessed by pressing `/` (slash) and typing the name or label of the resource you're looking for. This filters the list of resources accordingly, making it easier to locate the desired resource.

#### Editing Resources

Editing a resource in K9s is initiated by pressing `e` while the resource is selected. This action opens the resource in a text editor within K9s, where you can make your desired changes to the resource's configuration. Once you're satisfied with your modifications, press `Ctrl + S` to save the changes.

K9s supports inline editing, allowing quick adjustments to a resource without the need to open it in a text editor. To inline edit a resource, navigate to the field you wish to modify and begin typing. K9s automatically saves your changes upon pressing the `Enter` key, streamlining the editing process.

#### Deleting Resources

To delete a resource in K9s, select the resource and press `d`. K9s will then prompt you to confirm the deletion. To proceed, press `y` to confirm and delete the resource.


The provided text is accurate in terms of the general functionality of K9s, which indeed offers a comprehensive set of tools for managing various Kubernetes resource types. However, it's important to clarify that K9s operates primarily through a text-based interface and keyboard shortcuts, rather than using a "Help" button as described. Let's adjust the text to reflect the correct usage of K9s:

#### Managing Different Resource Types

K9s supports a wide variety of Kubernetes resource types, including pods, deployments, services, and nodes. Each resource type has its own unique set of fields and properties.

To learn more about a specific resource type in K9s, you can use the `?` key while viewing the resource. This action opens a help page that provides detailed information about the resource type, including its fields, properties, and supported actions.

You can see that K9s is a powerful tool for managing Kubernetes resources. It provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to view, edit, and delete resources. K9s also supports a wide variety of resource types, making it a valuable tool for managing complex Kubernetes clusters.

### Customizing K9s

K9s is a powerful and user-friendly terminal-based Kubernetes client that allows you to interact with your clusters and resources in a fast and efficient way. However, you may want to customize K9s to suit your personal preferences, needs, and workflows. In this section, we will explore the various customization options available in K9s and show you how to change themes, customize your configuration file, and utilize plugins to tailor K9s to your specific needs and preferences.

### Changing Themes

K9s does not use commands like `:theme` for changing themes. Instead, theme customization in K9s is managed through the configuration file. Here's how you can change themes in K9s:

#### Changing Themes

To change the theme in K9s, you need to edit the K9s configuration file, which is located at `~/.k9s.yaml`. In this file, you can specify the theme you want to use. K9s comes with a variety of built-in themes, such as `dark`, `light`, `monokai`, `solarized`, and more.

To change the theme, open the `~/.k9s.yaml` file in your favorite text editor and add or modify the `theme` setting under the `k9s` section. For example, to use the `dark` theme, you would add the following lines to the configuration file:

```yaml
k9s:
 theme: dark
```

After saving the changes to the configuration file, K9s will automatically apply the new theme the next time you start it.

#### Creating Custom Themes

While K9s does not directly support creating custom themes through a command or a separate configuration file like `~/.k9s/skins/my-theme.yaml`, you can customize the appearance of K9s by editing the `~/.k9s.yaml` file to specify colors for different UI elements. However, this approach requires a good understanding of the configuration options available in K9s and might not offer the same level of customization as creating a custom theme file.

For detailed information on configuring K9s, including theme settings and other customization options, refer to the [K9s documentation](https://k9scli.io/topics/config/).

#### Customizing the Configuration File

Another way to customize K9s is to edit its configuration file, which is located at `~/.k9s.yaml`. You can use this file to customize various aspects of K9s, such as the default namespace, view, and context, as well as the keyboard shortcuts, aliases, and filters for different resources.

To edit the configuration file, simply open it in your favorite text editor and make the desired changes. For example, to change the default namespace to `my-namespace`, you would add the following line to the configuration file:

```yaml
default_namespace: my-namespace
```

You can also use the `:config` command to open the configuration file in your default text editor. This command will automatically reload the configuration file after you save your changes.

You can find more information about the configuration file options in the [K9s documentation](https://k9scli.io/topics/config/).

#### Using Plugins

K9s supports plugins, which are external commands or scripts that can be invoked from within K9s to perform additional tasks or integrations. Plugins can be used to extend the functionality of K9s and tailor it to your specific needs. For example, you can use plugins to launch a web browser, run a shell command, or interact with other tools or services.

To install a plugin, download the plugin binary and place it in the `~/.k9s/plugins` directory. You can then use the `:plugin` command to load the plugin:

```
:plugin load my-plugin
```

Once the plugin is loaded, you can use the `:plugin` command to execute the plugin:

```
:plugin my-plugin
```

You can also pass arguments to the plugin by appending them to the command. For example, to pass the name of the current resource to the plugin, you would run the following command:

```
:plugin my-plugin $NAME
```

You can find more information about the plugin system and some examples of plugins in the [K9s documentation](https://k9scli.io/topics/plugins/).

In summary, K9s is a highly customizable tool that can be tailored to your specific needs and preferences. By changing themes, customizing the configuration file, and utilizing plugins, you can create a K9s experience that is both efficient and enjoyable. We hope this section has helped you learn how to customize K9s and make it your own.



### Advanced K9s Features

For more advanced users, we will delve into some of K9s' advanced features. We will cover port forwarding, executing commands within pods, and troubleshooting techniques. These features will empower you to perform complex tasks and gain deeper insights into your Kubernetes clusters.

#### Port Forwarding

Port forwarding allows you to access services running on a pod from your local machine, without exposing them to the public. This is useful for debugging, testing, or accessing internal APIs. To use port forwarding, you need to select a pod and press `f`. You will be prompted to enter the local and remote ports to forward. For example, if you want to forward port 8080 on the pod to port 3000 on your machine, you would enter `3000:8080`. You can also specify the container name if the pod has multiple containers. Once the port forwarding is established, you will see a message in the status bar. You can then access the service on your machine using `localhost:3000`.

#### Executing Commands

Executing commands allows you to run arbitrary commands within a pod's container. This is useful for inspecting the pod's state, running diagnostics, or performing maintenance tasks. To execute a command, you need to select a pod and press `x`. You will be prompted to enter the command to run. For example, if you want to run `ls -l` in the pod's container, you would enter `ls -l`. You can also specify the container name if the pod has multiple containers. The command output will be displayed in a new window. You can press `q` to quit the command window.

#### Troubleshooting Techniques

Troubleshooting techniques allow you to diagnose and resolve issues with your Kubernetes clusters. Some of the common techniques are:

- Viewing logs: You can view the logs of a pod's container by selecting the pod and pressing `l`. You can also filter the logs by pressing `/` and entering a search term. You can press `n` and `N` to navigate to the next and previous matches. You can press `q` to quit the log window.
- Viewing events: You can view the events of a resource by selecting the resource and pressing `e`. Events are records of significant occurrences in the cluster, such as pod creation, node failure, or service update. You can press `q` to quit the event window.
- Viewing describe: You can view the describe output of a resource by selecting the resource and pressing `d`. Describe output shows the detailed information and status of the resource, such as labels, annotations, spec, and conditions. You can press `q` to quit the describe window.
