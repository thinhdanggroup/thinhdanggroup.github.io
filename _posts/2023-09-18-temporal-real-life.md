### How Temporal Works

Temporal is a software development platform that acts as both a database and a service orchestrator. It provides a programming model that abstracts the complexity of writing distributed and reliable applications.

Temporal is composed of two main components: the Temporal Server and the Temporal Client SDKs.

#### Temporal Server

The Temporal Server is the core component of the Temporal system. It manages and coordinates the execution of workflows and activities. The server is responsible for storing workflow state information, scheduling and dispatching tasks, and managing workflow execution.

The Temporal Server is designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant. It can handle high loads and recover from failures, ensuring that your workflows continue to execute reliably.

#### Temporal Client SDKs

Temporal Client SDKs are libraries that developers use to interact with the Temporal Server. They provide an interface for starting and querying workflows, as well as scheduling and executing activities.

The SDKs abstract the complexities of distributed systems and fault-tolerant programming, allowing developers to focus on writing their business logic. Temporal currently provides SDKs for Go, Java, and Python.

### Temporal Architecture

Temporal's architecture consists of four main components:

1. Temporal Server
2. Temporal Client SDKs
3. Temporal System Workflows
4. Temporal Task Queues

Let's take a closer look at each of these components.

#### Temporal Server

The Temporal Server is the core component of the Temporal system. It manages and coordinates the execution of workflows and activities. The server is responsible for maintaining the state of workflows, scheduling tasks, and handling retries in case of failures.

#### Temporal Client SDKs

Temporal provides client SDKs in multiple programming languages, including Go, Java, and Python. Developers use these SDKs to interact with the Temporal Server. They provide an interface for starting and querying workflows, as well as scheduling and executing activities.

#### Temporal System Workflows

System Workflows are long-running, stateful processes that define the business logic and orchestration of a workflow. These workflows are written as code and executed by the Temporal Server. They can handle failures and retries, making them highly reliable.

An example of a system workflow is the stats aggregation Workflow in the 'reactor' scenario. This workflow increments an internal in-memory counter for every signal received and validates that the counter reaches the desired threshold.

#### Temporal Task Queues

Task Queues are used to group related activities and workflows. They provide a way to prioritize and distribute work across multiple workers in the system. Some of the task queues in Temporal include the purchase order, customer support resolution, and order confirmation task queues.

These four components work together to provide the robust functionality of Temporal. In the next sections, we will dive into the workflow of Temporal and discuss the best practices when using Temporal.


## Workflow of Temporal

### Workflow Execution

Temporal's Workflow Execution is a resilient, reliable, and scalable function execution. It's the primary unit of execution in a Temporal application. Each Workflow Execution has a unique identifier and maintains its state throughout its execution.

The Workflow Execution process starts with the initiation of a new workflow instance. The Temporal Server then schedules the first Workflow Task, which is picked up by a worker. The worker executes the task and returns the results to the Temporal Server, which then schedules the next task. This process continues until the workflow completes or fails.

The state of the workflow is persisted in the Temporal Server after each task completion, ensuring the durability of the workflow. If a worker fails during the execution of a task, the Temporal Server will detect the failure and reschedule the task. This makes the Workflow Execution resilient to worker failures.

### Workflow Code

The Workflow Code is the code that defines the logic and behavior of a workflow. It includes the definitions of tasks, activities, and their dependencies. The Workflow Code is written using one of the Temporal Client SDKs.

The Workflow Code is executed by workers. The workers poll the Temporal Server for tasks, execute the tasks, and return the results to the server. The Temporal Server then schedules the next tasks based on the workflow logic.

The Workflow Code is designed to be deterministic. This means that given the same inputs, the Workflow Code will produce the same outputs. This property is crucial for the replay of workflows, which allows Temporal to recover the state of a workflow after a failure.

### Workflow Instance

A Workflow Instance refers to a single execution of a workflow. Each instance has a unique identifier and maintains its own state throughout its execution.

A Workflow Instance is initiated when a new workflow is started. The Temporal Server then schedules the first task of the workflow and sends it to a worker. The worker executes the task and returns the results to the Temporal Server. The server then schedules the next task based on the workflow logic.

The state of a Workflow Instance is persisted in the Temporal Server after each task completion. This allows Temporal to recover the state of a workflow after a failure.

### Workflow Tasks

Workflow Tasks are the individual units of work that need to be performed as part of a workflow. They can include activities, timers, and child workflows.

Workflow Tasks are scheduled by the Temporal Server and executed by workers. The workers poll the Temporal Server for tasks, execute the tasks, and return the results to the server. The server then schedules the next tasks based on the workflow logic.

Workflow Tasks can be retried in case of failures. The Temporal Server will detect task failures and automatically reschedule the tasks. This makes the execution of Workflow Tasks resilient to failures.

### Workflow Signals

Workflow Signals are a way to communicate with a running Workflow Instance from external systems. They can be used to trigger certain actions or provide input to the workflow.

Workflow Signals are sent to the Temporal Server, which then delivers them to the appropriate Workflow Instance. The Workflow Instance can handle the signals based on the logic defined in the Workflow Code.

Workflow Signals provide a way to interact with a running workflow in real-time. They can be used to update the state of a workflow, trigger actions, or influence the workflow logic.

In the next section, we will discuss the best practices of Temporal and how to use Temporal in real life and production scenarios.

### Temporal Performance Tuning

To tune the performance of Temporal, it's important to monitor key metrics, configure the metrics subsystem, set up monitoring, and perform load testing. The Temporal Server emits various metrics for service usage, persistence operations, and workflow execution stats. These metrics can be used to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

Performance tuning practices for Temporal also involve optimizing the performance of time-sensitive applications and systems by reducing latency and improving the efficiency of time-related operations. This can include optimizing time synchronization algorithms, using caching and indexing techniques for time-based data, and optimizing time-dependent workflows and processes.

### Temporal Monitoring and Observability

Temporal supports three metrics providers out of the box: StatsD, Prometheus, and M3. Monitoring can be set up using Grafana dashboards, and key metrics like `schedule_to_start_latency` should be tracked. Load testing can be performed using tools like the Maru benchmarking tool.

Monitoring and observability practices for Temporal involve monitoring and logging time-related events and metrics to ensure the accuracy and reliability of time-sensitive systems. This includes monitoring time synchronization status, detecting and alerting on time drift or clock skew, and analyzing time-based performance metrics.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use Temporal in real-life and production scenarios.
