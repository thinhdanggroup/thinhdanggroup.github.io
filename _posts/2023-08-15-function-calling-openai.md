In the next section, we will look at some real-world examples of function calling in OpenAI.

## Examples of Function Calling in OpenAI

To truly understand the power and versatility of function calling in OpenAI, let's walk through a step-by-step example
using Python. In this example, we will use OpenAI's GPT model to perform two tasks: translating text from English to
Vietnamese and fetching current weather information for a specific location. We will be using the OpenAI API, along with
two external APIs for translation and weather information. You can find the full code for this example on [GitHub](https://github.com/thinhdanggroup/thinhdanggroup.github.io/tree/master/playground/function_calling).

### Setting Up the Environment

First, we need to set up the environment. We will use several Python libraries,
including `openai`, `requests` and `pydantic`. We also need to set up the
environment variables for OpenAI API key, the API base URL, and the API version. This can be done using a `.env` file.

```python

import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv

GPT_MODEL = os.getenv("MODEL_CONFIG_DEPLOYMENT")


def load_config():
    load_dotenv(dotenv_path=".env", override=True, verbose=True)
    openai.api_type = "azure"
    openai.api_key = os.getenv("MODEL_CONFIG_KEY")
    openai.api_base = os.getenv("MODEL_CONFIG_BASE")
    openai.api_version = os.getenv("MODEL_CONFIG_VERSION")
```

### Defining External API Functions

Next, we define the functions that will interact with the external APIs. In this case, we have two
functions: `translate()` and `get_weather()`. The `translate()` function takes a string of text as input and returns its
translation in Vietnamese. The `get_weather()` function takes a location as input and returns the current weather
information for that location.

```python
def translate(text):
    url = "https://text-translator2.p.rapidapi.com/translate"

    payload = {
        "source_language": "en",
        "target_language": "vi",
        "text": text
    }
    headers = {
        "content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        "X-RapidAPI-Key": os.getenv("RAPIDAPI_KEY"),
        "X-RapidAPI-Host": "text-translator2.p.rapidapi.com"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers)

    body = response.json()
    if body["status"] == "success":
        return body["data"]["translatedText"]
    else:
        return "can not translate"


def get_weather(location):
    url = "https://visual-crossing-weather.p.rapidapi.com/forecast"

    querystring = {"aggregateHours": "24", "location": location, "contentType": "json", "unitGroup": "us",
                   "shortColumnNames": "0"}

    headers = {
        "X-RapidAPI-Key": os.getenv("RAPIDAPI_KEY"),
        "X-RapidAPI-Host": "visual-crossing-weather.p.rapidapi.com"
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=querystring)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return "Can not get weather"
    data = response.json()
    return data["locations"][location]["values"][0]
```

### Defining Function Call Schema

We then define the function call schema using Pydantic's BaseModel class. This schema describes the parameters that the
function accepts.

```python
class GetCurrentWeather(BaseModel):
    location: str = Field(..., description="The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA")


class Translate(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(..., description="The text to translate")
```

### Making the Function Call

Finally, we make the function call. We start by setting up the initial system and user messages. We then call
the `chat_completion_request()` function, which sends a request to the OpenAI API and returns a response. If the
assistant message in the response contains a function call, we execute the function call using
the `execute_function_call()` function and append the result to the messages. We then print out the conversation using
the `pretty_print_conversation()` function.

```python
def main():
    load_config()
    functions = [
        {
            "name": "get_current_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather",
            "parameters": GetCurrentWeather.model_json_schema(),
        },
        {
            "name": "translate",
            "description": "Translate from English to Vietnamese",
            "parameters": Translate.model_json_schema(),
        },
    ]

    messages = []
    messages.append({"role": "system",
                     "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."})
    messages.append({"role": "user",
                     "content": "Translate 'How are you' to Vietnamese"})
    chat_response = chat_completion_request(
        messages, functions=functions, function_call="auto"
    )
    assistant_message = chat_response["choices"][0]["message"]
    messages.append(assistant_message)
    if assistant_message.get("function_call"):
        results = execute_function_call(assistant_message)
        messages.append({"role": "function", "name": assistant_message["function_call"]["name"], "content": results})
    pretty_print_conversation(messages)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example demonstrates the power and versatility of function calling in OpenAI. By leveraging this feature,
developers can create more interactive and dynamic applications that seamlessly integrate with external tools and APIs.
