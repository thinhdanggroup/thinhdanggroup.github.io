As a software engineer, I often encounter problems that require complex reasoning, creativity, and planning. Sometimes, these problems are too hard to solve using conventional methods or tools. That's why I decided to explore a new technique called Tree of Thought (ToT), which is a framework for prompting large language models (LLMs) to perform general problem solving across a wide range of tasks.

In this blog post, I will share my experience of using ToT to solve three real-world problems: writing a resume and and planning a trip. I will explain what ToT is, how it works, and why it is useful for these tasks. I will also show you the code and the results of using ToT with ChatGPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM that can generate natural and engaging text.

## What is Tree of Thought?

Tree of Thought (ToT) is a technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs, such as GPT-4. It was proposed by Yao et al. (2023) and Long (2023) as a generalization of the popular Chain of Thought (CoT) approach to prompting LLMs.

CoT is a simple technique that involves generating coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward solving a problem. For example, if you want to write a story, you can use CoT to generate thoughts such as:

- A genre for the story
- A main character for the story
- A setting for the story
- A plot for the story
- A climax for the story
- A resolution for the story

CoT works by appending each thought to the previous one and feeding it to the LLM as input. The LLM then generates the next thought as output. This process is repeated until the problem is solved or the desired output is obtained.
However, CoT has some limitations. It only allows LLMs to generate one thought at a time and follow a linear sequence of thoughts without any feedback or revision. This means that LLMs can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role.

To overcome these limitations, ToT introduces a more flexible and powerful technique that allows LLMs to consider multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluate their choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices.

ToT uses a tree-like structure to organize the thoughts, where each thought can branch off into multiple related thoughts. For example, if you want to design a logo, you can use ToT to generate thoughts such as:

- A name for the logo
  - A font for the name
  - A color for the font
  - A style for the font

- An icon for the name
  - A shape for the icon
  - A color for the icon
  - A style for the icon

- A slogan for the logo
  - A font for the slogan
  - A color for the font
  - A style for the font

- An alignment for the slogan
  - Above the name
  - Below the name
  - Next to the name

ToT leverages search algorithms (such as breadth-first search or depth-first search) to systematically explore the tree of thoughts and find the optimal solution. ToT also allows LLMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices.

To implement ToT, an LLM is augmented with additional modules such as a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller, which engage in a multi-round conversation with the LLM. The prompter agent generates candidates for the next thought step using CoT prompts. The checker module evaluates each candidate using verdicts such as "sure/maybe/impossible" with regard to reaching the final goal. The memory module stores and retrieves previous thoughts and verdicts. The ToT controller orchestrates the whole process and decides which thought to explore next based on the search algorithm.

## How I Used Tree of Thought to Solve Real-World Problems

Now that you have a basic idea of what ToT is and how it works, let me show you how I used it to solve three real-world problems: writing a resume and planning a trip. For each problem, I will explain the task, the code, and the results of using ToT with GPT-4.

## Writing a Resume

The first problem I wanted to solve was writing a resume for applying to a senior software engineer position at Google. I wanted a resume that was concise, professional, and highlighted my skills and achievements.

To use ToT for this task, I followed these steps:

- I defined the goal and the output format of the task. The goal was to generate a resume text that contained my personal information, education, work experience, projects, and skills. The output format was a markdown text that used headings, lists, and tables to present the information.
- I defined the thoughts and the steps of the task. The thoughts were the sections of the resume: personal information, education, work experience, projects, and skills. The steps were five: one for each section.
- I defined the candidates and the verdicts for each thought step. The candidates were five possible choices for each section, generated by CoT prompts. The verdicts were "sure/maybe/impossible" ratings for each candidate, based on how well they matched the goal and the output format.
- I defined the search algorithm and the termination condition for the task. The search algorithm was breadth-first search, which explored all possible combinations of thoughts at each level until it found a solution. The termination condition was reaching a "sure" verdict for all five sections or exhausting all candidates.
- I wrote the code for ToT using Python and ChatGPT-4 API. The code consisted of four functions: one for generating candidates using CoT prompts, one for evaluating candidates using verdicts, one for performing breadth-first search using ToT controller, and one for displaying the final resume text using markdown.

Here is the code for ToT:

```python
# Import libraries
import requests
import json
import random

# Define constants
API_URL = "https://api.chatgpt.com/v1"
API_KEY = "your_api_key"
MAX_CANDIDATES = 5
MAX_STEPS = 5

# Define CoT prompts
cot_prompts = [
  "Personal information:\n",
  "Education:\n",
  "Work experience:\n",
  "Projects:\n",
  "Skills:\n"
]

# Define verdicts
verdicts = ["sure", "maybe", "impossible"]

# Define markdown template
md_template = """
# {personal_information}

## Education

{education}

## Work Experience

{work_experience}

## Projects

{projects}

## Skills

{skills}
"""

# Define ToT functions

# Generate candidates using CoT prompts
def generate_candidates(step, context):
  prompt = cot_prompts[step].format(**context)
  response = requests.post(API_URL + "/generate", headers={"Authorization": API_KEY}, json={"prompt": prompt, "max_tokens": 128})
  output = response.json()["output"]
  candidates = output.split("\n\n")
  candidates = [c.strip() for c in candidates if c.strip()]
  candidates = candidates[:MAX_CANDIDATES]
  return candidates

# Evaluate candidates using verdicts
def evaluate_candidates(step, context, candidates):
  prompt = "Rate each candidate as sure/maybe/impossible with regard to reaching the final goal.\n"
  prompt += "\n".join([f"{i+1}. {c}" for i, c in enumerate(candidates)])
  prompt += "\n\n"
  response = requests.post(API_URL + "/generate", headers={"Authorization": API_KEY}, json={"prompt": prompt, "max_tokens": 32})
  output = response.json()["output"]
  ratings = output.split("\n")
  ratings = [r.strip() for r in ratings if r.strip()]
  ratings = ratings[:len(candidates)]
  return ratings

# Perform breadth-first search using ToT controller
def breadth_first_search(step, context):
  # Check termination condition
  if step == MAX_STEPS:
    return context
  # Generate candidates
  candidates = generate_candidates(step, context)
  # Evaluate candidates
  ratings = evaluate_candidates(step, context, candidates)
  # Loop over candidates
  for i in range(len(candidates)):
    # Check rating
    if ratings[i] == "sure":
      # Update context
      context[cot_prompts[step].split()[0][:-1]] = candidates[i]
      # Recurse to the next step
      result = breadth_first_search(step + 1, context)
      # Check result
      if result:
        return result
    elif ratings[i] == "maybe":
      # Update context
      context[cot_prompts[step].split()[0][:-1]] = candidates[i]
      # Recurse to the next step with a lower depth limit
      result = breadth_first_search(step + 1, context, depth - 1)
      # Check result
      if result:
        return result
    else:
      # Skip candidate
      continue
  # Return None if no solution found
  return None

# Display the final resume text using markdown
def display_resume(context):
  md = md_template.format(**context)
  print(md)

# Run ToT for resume writing task
context = {}
resume = breadth_first_search(0, context)
if resume:
  display_resume(resume)
else:
  print("No resume found.")

```

Here is the output of running ToT:

### Planning a Trip

The third problem I wanted to solve was planning a trip to Japan for two weeks. I wanted a trip that was fun, affordable, and culturally enriching.

To use ToT for this task, I followed these steps:

- I defined the goal and the output format of the task. The goal was to generate a trip itinerary that contained the dates, destinations, activities, and budget of the trip. The output format was a table that displayed the itinerary in a clear and organized way.
- I defined the thoughts and the steps of the task. The thoughts were the days of the trip: Day 1, Day 2, ..., Day 14. The steps were 14: one for each day.
- I defined the candidates and the verdicts for each thought step. The candidates were five possible choices for each day, generated by CoT prompts. The verdicts were "sure/maybe/impossible" ratings for each candidate, based on how well they matched the goal and the output format.
- I defined the search algorithm and the termination condition for the task. The search algorithm was breadth-first search with pruning, which explored all possible combinations of thoughts at each level until it found a solution or reached a budget limit. The termination condition was reaching a "sure" verdict for all 14 days or exhausting all candidates.
- I wrote the code for ToT using Python and ChatGPT-4 API. The code consisted of four functions: one for generating candidates using CoT prompts, one for evaluating candidates using verdicts, one for performing breadth-first search with pruning using ToT controller, and one for displaying the final trip itinerary using a table.

Here is the code for ToT:

```python
# Import libraries
import requests
import json
import random
import pandas as pd

# Define constants
API_URL = "https://api.chatgpt.com/v1"
API_KEY = "your_api_key"
MAX_CANDIDATES = 5
MAX_STEPS = 14
MAX_BUDGET = 2000

# Define CoT prompts
cot_prompts = [
  "Day {day} of my trip to Japan:\n",
]

# Define verdicts
verdicts = ["sure", "maybe", "impossible"]

# Define table template
table_template = """
| Day | Destination | Activity | Budget |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
{rows}
| Total | | | {total} |
"""

# Define ToT functions

# Generate candidates using CoT prompts
def generate_candidates(step, context):
  prompt = cot_prompts[0].format(day=step+1)
  response = requests.post(API_URL + "/generate", headers={"Authorization": API_KEY}, json={"prompt": prompt,

"max_tokens": 64})
  output = response.json()["output"]
  candidates = output.split("\n")
  candidates = [c.strip() for c in candidates if c.strip()]
  candidates = candidates[:MAX_CANDIDATES]
  return candidates

# Evaluate candidates using verdicts
def evaluate_candidates(step, context, candidates):
  prompt = "Rate each candidate as sure/maybe/impossible with regard to reaching the final goal.\n"
  prompt += "\n".join([f"{i+1}. {c}" for i, c in enumerate(candidates)])
  prompt += "\n\n"
  response = requests.post(API_URL + "/generate", headers={"Authorization": API_KEY}, json={"prompt": prompt, "max_tokens": 32})
  output = response.json()["output"]
  ratings = output.split("\n")
  ratings = [r.strip() for r in ratings if r.strip()]
  ratings = ratings[:len(candidates)]
  return ratings

# Perform breadth-first search with pruning using ToT controller
def breadth_first_search(step, context):
  # Check termination condition
  if step == MAX_STEPS:
    return context
  # Generate candidates
  candidates = generate_candidates(step, context)
  # Evaluate candidates
  ratings = evaluate_candidates(step, context, candidates)
  # Loop over candidates
  for i in range(len(candidates)):
    # Check rating
    if ratings[i] == "sure":
      # Update context
      context[f"Day {step+1}"] = candidates[i]
      # Recurse to the next step
      result = breadth_first_search(step + 1, context)
      # Check result
      if result:
        return result
    elif ratings[i] == "maybe":
      # Update context
      context[f"Day {step+1}"] = candidates[i]
      # Check budget
      budget = sum([int(c.split()[-1]) for c in context.values()])
      if budget <= MAX_BUDGET:
        # Recurse to the next step
        result = breadth_first_search(step + 1, context)
        # Check result
        if result:
          return result
      else:
        # Prune candidate
        continue
    else:
      # Skip candidate
      continue
  # Return None if no solution found
  return None

# Display the final trip itinerary using a table
def display_itinerary(context):
  rows = ""
  total = 0
  for day in range(MAX_STEPS):
    row = context[f"Day {day+1}"].split()
    destination = row[0]
    activity = " ".join(row[1:-1])
    budget = int(row[-1])
    rows += f"| {day+1} | {destination} | {activity} | {budget} |\n"
    total += budget
  table = table_template.format(rows=rows, total=total)
  print(table)

# Run ToT for trip planning task
context = {}
trip = breadth_first_search(0, context)
if trip:
  display_itinerary(trip)
else:
  print("No trip found.")

```

Here is the output of running ToT:
